 <h1>Best Series According to Amarachi</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 Series of all-time (in no particular order)</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Suits</h3>
 <p>Suits is an intelligent series. It easily made legal drama stylish and even more captivating, keeps you hooked! Donna was my all-time fave. The series just like many others was great early on, buttt the formula eventually starts to repeat and felt a bit annoying at some point. Still, it’s a solid, satisfying watch overall. I'll give it a 7.5/8 out of 10</p>

 <h3>How to Get Away With Murder</h3>
 <p>How to Get Away with Murder is an intense, brilliant series that kept me on edge and fully locked in throughout. Annalise was the most intriguing character for me; confusing, frustrating, and eventually deeply understandable. The students were honestly the most annoying part. The twists were mostly smart and consistently impressive. It stressed me out, excited me, and kept me bingeing anyway. A solid 8.5/10.</p>

 <h3>Snowfall</h3>
 <p>Snowfall is a raw/real and powerful series that slowly pulled me in and left a strong impression. It felt grounded and realistic, really showing how addictive money and power can be. Leon stood out as the most impactful character for me. The show maintained its quality through most of its run and left me impressed and reflective, even if it’s not something I’d fully rewatch. A solid 8/10.</p>
