<title>About Me</title>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a physiologist in training with a focused interest in cardiac physiology and hands-on clinical experience across diagnostic procedures. I am committed to understanding both the technical and interpretive aspects of my work, with a strong emphasis on accuracy, learning, and professional growth. My goal is to build a solid foundation that allows me to contribute meaningfully in clinical and healthcare environments.</p>

<p>Beyond my clinical training, I am intentional about personal development and skill building. I value consistency, clear systems, and continuous improvement, and I actively work to strengthen these through learning, reflection, and structured practice. I approach every role with responsibility, curiosity, and a willingness to learn, qualities that allow me to adapt quickly and grow within a team.</p>

<p>This website serves as a portfolio and learning space where I document my skills, projects, and progress. It reflects my commitment to growth, reliability, and delivering value. I am open to opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and work with people who value excellence, integrity, and long-term development.</p>
